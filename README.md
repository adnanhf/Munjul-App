# Munjul-App

### Overview
This is a simple information system application using Java GUI and SQL in Oracle. Coded in Netbeans 8.0.2. It main task is to save transaction history, like income or spending. Not limited to development, feel free to download and change this source code.

### Requirement
You must satisfied this minimum requirement first:
* [Netbeans 8.0.2](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/articles/javase/jdk-netbeans-jsp-142931.html)  
The link that has been shared, is the distribution from Oracle, consists of Java SE and NetBeans IDE. So you can have Java and it's IDE at once.
* [Oracle XE 11g Release 2](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/database/database-technologies/express-edition/downloads/index.html)  
With using XE edition, you don't have to good at terminal/cmd, now you can choose to do CRUD or put some SQL commands via browser.
* [ojdbc7.jar](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/database/features/jdbc/jdbc-drivers-12c-download-1958347.html)  
This file will help you to connect with the Oracle XE, save it in `JAVA_PARENT_FOLDER`, it could be named jre.version or jdk.version. This is example from my case:  
`JAVA_PARENT_FOLDER\jre\lib\ext\your ojdbc.jar file`

### JAVA and SQL
After all requirements satisfied, prepare a null project from Netbeans. Then import all file from this repository to your `Netbeans Projects` folder, then save it to:
`Projects Folder/src/yourpackage/filename.java`. Don't forget to download the SQL file.
